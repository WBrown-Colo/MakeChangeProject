## Lessons Learned
The fact that I have not been able to get my register to work means that I have only learned what does not work. I have been having issues with the final output calculation of each denomination. Currently it tells me how much I need of each denomination to meet the original change due. It does not change as other denominations are already deducted. I am very eager to find out what I have been doing wrong when the assignment is turned in.

After submission with feedback, I learned that I needed to deduct the balance already pulled from the drawer when I declared my variables instead of in my if statements.
